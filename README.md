# DNN-Speech-Recognizer
> The Project includes the building of the **speech recognition model for recognising the english speech and predict french text from spoken words**.
## Content of project
> The project includes different Machine Learning models and comparisons bettween them and different technique for improving the models.

  * ### Models in the project : ### 
    1. RNN
    2. RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
    3. CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
    4. Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
    5. Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
    6. Final Model

  * ### Comparing the models ###
